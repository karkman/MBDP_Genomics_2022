## General introduction

Microbial community structure and diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As HGT sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, sequencing populations of bacteria across the whole genome provides unprecedented resolution to investigate within-host evolution, transmission history, and population structure. During the one week course the students will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to analyze bacterial genomes, perform population genetic analyses and visualize their results. The goal is to become familiar with the bioinformatic analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in own research after the course.

## Schedule

The course will be from Monday 28th of March to Friday 1st of April in EE-building, Viikki.
